            <a>  I feel like i'm best at typing and Coding, in other words working in HTML & CSS, also known as making a website all from scratch.Even though it is very difficult at times i still feel like i am able to get through it.  I also feel like i'm very well in Math and History. Even though a couple of years ago i really wasnt good at math, this year my math teacher Ms. Crevellie helped me and helped me to get better at ATM and also help me to make sure i was doing all of the steps right.</a>
