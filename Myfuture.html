            <h3>Highschool i am planning to attend</h3>
            <p> The highschool i am planning on attending is Lakewood highschool, i am planning on attending this highschool because it is right down the street from where i live, and also my older brothers went there, and i feel like it would just be the best for me to go there. I would like to go into the DMAC program. Which is the digital media arts and communication program. Even though i am in ATM right now, i feel like i should change because i will have options to what i would want to do when i am older.
